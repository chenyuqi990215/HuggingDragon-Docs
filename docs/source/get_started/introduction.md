## Introduction

HuggingDragon is an advanced and unified framework designed to revolutionize trajectory-based applications within the realm of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). With its comprehensive and extensible nature, HuggingDragon offers researchers a robust experimental tool and a convenient development framework, facilitating the exploration and implementation of trajectory-based applications. This unified framework, implemented using PyTorch, integrates all essential components and steps related to traffic prediction into a streamlined and systematic pipeline, empowering researchers to conduct comprehensive experiments with ease. By prioritizing standardization and reproducibility, HuggingDragon aims to contribute significantly to the advancement of the field of trajectory based applications in intelligent transportation systems.

Currently, the framework supports the following key tasks:

* Trajectory Recovery: This task focuses on recovering missing trajectory points from a given trajectory with a low sample rate, enabling the reconstruction of a more complete trajectory.

* Trajectory Similarity: The framework also facilitates finding the most similar trajectory among a given set of trajectories, allowing for effective comparison and analysis.

To provide a comprehensive solution, HuggingDragon intends to expand its capabilities by incorporating additional tasks in the near future. These planned tasks include:

* Route Representation Learning (RRL): RRL aims to learn trajectory representations in a self-supervised manner, enabling enhanced understanding and analysis of trajectory data.

* Estimation of Time of Arrival (ETA): ETA focuses on predicting the travel time of a trajectory, offering valuable insights for planning and optimizing transportation routes.

* Trajectory Modeling: HuggingDragon will provide the ability to learn a generative model that estimates the density of a set of trajectories, enabling the understanding and modeling of trajectory patterns.

* Next Point of Interest (POI) Recommendation: This task focuses on predicting the next POI points given a user's history trajectory, providing personalized recommendations and enhancing user experiences in navigation and location-based services.

* Traffic Signal Control: This task aims to incorporate traffic signal control based on historical trajectories, allowing for intelligent and data-driven management of traffic signals to optimize traffic flow.

With these planned tasks, HuggingDragon aspires to provide a comprehensive and unified framework that empowers researchers and practitioners in the ITS field to address critical challenges and drive advancements in trajectory-based applications.
