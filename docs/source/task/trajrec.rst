Introduction
############

GPS trajectories are essential foundations for applications such as travel time estimation, traffic prediction, and trajectory similarity measurement. However, real-life trajectories often suffer from low sample rates, limiting their effectiveness. Additionally, existing map matching algorithms face challenges with low-sample trajectories. Trajectory recovery aims to increase the sample rate by filling in missing points, enriching low-sample trajectories.
